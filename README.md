## Description

This project a port of my original portfolio (made with vanilla JS and located [here](https://craigrobertsdev.github.io/portfolio/)). For this project, I used React to create a smooth, single-page application experience for the user with a clean UI and simple navigation.

## What I Learned

This is my first experience creating a React application from scratch (although it was bootstrapped with `create-react-app`). The main difficulty faced with this project was that it is deployeds to GitHub pages and hosted as a static site. This required a workaround of my implementation of routing with React Router, as the platform does not support the standard method of routing using this package.

This project has provided significant experience in managing state, on-load effects and the general project structure and nuance of creating apps with React.

## Usage

This application is deployed via GitHub Pages at https://craigrobertsdev.github.io/react-portfolio/#/.
